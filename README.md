## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I started with a mobile-first workflow. As I moved into the responsive design, that's when I added the CSS Grid (for the first time while working on these FrontEnd Mentor projects).
Additionally, I tried to stay exclusively with rem units, but that caused some grief as I went into responsive design. Everything looked too small on larger screens; then when I tried to adjust the rem units for the breakpoints, then everything seemed too big!

### Continued development

I need more hands-on practice with CSS Grid, and determining when to implement it in the creation process.
I also need more practice with rem and em units, so that they adjust automatically for responsive design, as opposed to me having to make multiple manual adjustments while creating breakpoints.
